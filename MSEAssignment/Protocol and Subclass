Protocol:
* It is a group of related properties and methods that can be implemented by any class.
* They let us reuse a single API decleration in unrelated classes.
* They can be used for type-checking.
* We can inherit protocols from other protocols.

Subclass:
* A subclass inherits methods and instance variables from its superclasses.
* It can override methods and instance variables from its superclass.
* It needs a interface and implementation file.
